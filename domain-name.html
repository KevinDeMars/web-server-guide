        <h1>Acquiring a domain name</h1>
        <p>Note: This step is optional.</p>
        <p>A domain name is the address you type in in your web browser (e.g. example.com.) To get one for your server, you need to have a 
            domain registrar assign you one. One way to do this is through <a href="domains.google.com">Google Domains</a>.
        </p>

        <p>Search for a domain name you want for your website. The ideal name is short, easy to remember, is comprised
            of correctly-spelled words or names, and doesn't have a sketchy-sounding ending like ".xyz". Many domain names are cheap ($12 per year is common),
            but you may have to compromise to find one that is both available and cheap.</p>

        <p>Once you purchase a domain name, you need to ask the registrar to make it "point to" your website. This is done using an "A Resource Record", which
            maps your domain name to an IPv4 address. I recommend creating two mappings; one for just your domain name (example.com) and one with "www" in front of it.
        </p>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Determine your router's public IP address by going <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">here.</a></li>
            <li>Login to your domain registrar's website and create a new resource record.</li>
            <li>Leave the part in front of your domain name blank. Set the type to "A" and the data to your public IP address.</li>
            <li>Repeat the previous steps with another resource record with "www" in front of it.</li>
            <li>The records should look something like this:
                <a href="img/rr.png"><img src="img/rr.png" /></a>
            </li>
            <li>Wait a few minutes for your changes to cascade across the internet.</li>
            <li>Now, anyone should be able to connect to your website by typing in your domain name.</li>
        </ol>
