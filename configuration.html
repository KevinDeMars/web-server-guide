        <h1>Configuration</h1>
        <p>Open the file "C:\Apache24\conf\httpd.conf" with a text editor.</p>
        <p>Lines starting with a "#" are comments, which means they don't do anything; they just help explain. You will notice that most of the lines are comments,
            because web servers are complicated and we really need them to figure out what's going on.
        </p>

        <h2>Basic options</h2>
        <p>If you follow this guide and leave everything as the default, you won't need to change the following options, but they are important:</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>ServerRoot &lt;file path&gt;</dt>
            <dd>Location where you put the server folder after extracting. If you moved the folder to "C:\Apache24" as specified in the installation section, you don't need to change this.</dd>
            <dt>Listen &lt;port number&gt;</dt>
            <dd>Tells Apache to listen for web traffic on the given port. You should, most of the time, leave it as the default of 80. If you
                change it, people will need to specify the port number when they visit your website (e.g. "example.com:12345")
            </dd>
            <dt>DocumentRoot &lt;file path&gt;</dt>
            <dd>This is the where the files are that people can view by connecting to the server. For example, if the DocumentRoot is "C:\Stuff", and you have the domain name
                of "example.com", then people can view the file at "C:\Stuff\myFile.html" by entering "example.com/myFile.html".
                <br/>
                By default, this is "C:\Apache24\htdocs".
            </dd>
        </dl>

        <p>The following option is <b>not set by default</b>, which is why we got the warning in the "Installation" step. It is currently commented out with a "#". Remove the "#".</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>ServerName &lt;address&gt;:&lt;port number&gt;</dt>
        </dl>
        <p>Obtaining a readable address like "example.com" will be discussed in a later section. For now, set it to your <b>public/routable</b> IP address with a port of 80. For example, my setting is "ServerName 67.198.92.243:80".</p>
        <p>To find your IP address, the easiest way is to go to a website that tells it to you, such as <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/">this one</a>.</p>

        <h2>Notice: About Security</h2>
        <p>You should always have security in mind when configuring your web server. By default, everything inside your DocumentRoot is publicly accessible to everyone on
            the internet. Sensitive information (configuration files, passwords, etc.) should not be in the DocumentRoot. If you do need to add sensitive information,
            configure it so that it is not public.
        </p>
        <p>Many security vulnerabilities are caused by incorrect configuration. The config file gives a "friendly" reminder:</p>
        <pre>
# Do NOT simply read the instructions in here without understanding
# what they do.  They're here only as hints or reminders.  If you are unsure
# consult the online docs. You have been warned.  
        </pre>
        <p>The same applies to this guide. If you don't understand how to configure something, do more research. Don't just guess.</p>

        <h2>Access Control</h2>
        <p>Access control is done using a series of scopes, defined by a &lt;Directory&gt; tag (other similar tags exist). Inside the tag is a series of configuration values that apply to everything in that folder (even subfolders).</p>
        <p>If multiple scopes apply, the more specific one overrides the less specific one. For example, if you grant access to "C:\folder1\aaa", but deny access to "C:\folder1\aaa\bbb", then
            everyone will have access to "folder1\aaa" but won't have access to "folder1\aaa\bbb".
        </p>
        <p>By default, there are two entries. One that blocks access to everything, and one that grants access to everything inside the htdocs folder, which looks like this:</p>
        <pre>
&lt;Directory "${SRVROOT}/htdocs"&gt;
    #
    # Possible values for the Options directive are "None", "All",
    # or any combination of:
    #   Indexes Includes FollowSymLinks SymLinksifOwnerMatch ExecCGI MultiViews
    #
    # Note that "MultiViews" must be named *explicitly* --- "Options All"
    # doesn't give it to you.
    #
    # The Options directive is both complicated and important.  Please see
    # http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/core.html#options
    # for more information.
    #
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks

    #
    # AllowOverride controls what directives may be placed in .htaccess files.
    # It can be "All", "None", or any combination of the keywords:
    #   AllowOverride FileInfo AuthConfig Limit
    #
    AllowOverride None

    #
    # Controls who can get stuff from this server.
    #
    Require all granted
&lt;/Directory&gt;
        </pre>
        <p><b>Caution:</b> "Indexes" is enabled by default. This means that people can see a listing of all the files/folders within the specified folder.
            Even though everything in your DocumentRoot should be treated as public unless manually changed, this might not be what you want:
        </p>
        <img src="img/indexes.png" />

        <p>Remove "Indexes" if you don't need an automatic file listing.</p>

        <h2>Port forwarding</h2>
        <p>See the introduction for a short explanation of port forwarding.</p>
        <p>This process is a bit tricky because the exact steps depend on what kind of router you have. The general process will look something like this:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Find your router's private IP address and your computer's private IP address:</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Open the command prompt.</li>
                <li>Enter "ipconfig".</li>
                <li>You will see several internet adapters listed. Look for one that has a non-blank "Default Gateway". It will very likely be 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1.</li>
                <li>Your computer's IP address will be listed under the same internet adapter, labelled "IPv4 address".</li>
            </ol>
            <li>In your browser, enter http://&lt;router's IP address&gt;</li>
            <li>You should see your router's admin login page. Log in with your admin credentials. If you don't know it, try looking up "&lt;Your router's brand name&gt; router default admin login".</li>
            <li>Go to Firewall settings.</li>
            <img src="img/firewall-settings.png" />
            <li>Go to "Port forwarding". Mine is labelled "Virtual servers / Port forwarding".</li>
            <img src="img/port-forwarding-page.png" />
            <li>Forward incoming TCP traffic that is bound to your router's port 80, to your computer's port 80. Follow the below image (but replace the IP address with yours).</li>
            <img src="img/http-forward.png" />
            <li>Repeat for port 443, for HTTPS.</li>
            <li>Your table should now have these two entries:</li>
            <img src="img/forwarding-table.png" />
        </ol>

        <h2>Check for errors</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Run the server through the Command Prompt one more time (so you can see the errors on the console). See the "Installation" section.</li>
            <li>If you set the ServerName directive, you should no longer see the warning you got before. In fact, nothing should be printed to the console.</li>
            <li>Test that you can access your server in your web browser using your external IP address (e.g. 67.198.92.243).</li>
            <li>Now, anyone should be able to connect to your web server if they have your IP address. Have a friend (who isn't in the same building) try to connect
                to test if the port forwarding worked correctly.</li>
        </ol>
