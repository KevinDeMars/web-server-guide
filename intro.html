		<h1>Introduction</h1>
		<h2>Goal of this guide</h2>
		<p>This guide is designed for beginners who are interested in the idea of running a web server but don't really know anything about them. It it written for 
			the Apache web server on a Windows operating system, although most of the steps will be very similar across operating systems and web servers.
		</p>
		<p>After finishing this guide, you will be able to run a server from your computer that can either run a website, or host whatever arbitrary files you want
			so that anybody can download them.</p>
		<p>The required steps will let you set up the server for free so that people can go to your website by typing in your IP address in their browser. (e.g. http://93.184.216.34) There are
			optional steps that guide you towards acquiring a domain name (cheap, but not free) so people can type in your website's URL in their browser.
		</p>

		<h2>What is a web server?</h2>
		<p>The answer to this question is more nebulous than you might expect. A web server is anything that listens for HTTP requests and responds with an HTTP response.</p>
		<p>The Apache Software Foundation describes two main categories of web servers:</p>
		<p>"Web site content can take many different forms, but may be broadly divided into static and dynamic content. Static content is things like HTML files, image files, CSS files,
			 and other files that reside in the filesystem... Dynamic content is anything that is generated at request time, and may change from one request to another. 
			 There are numerous ways that dynamic content may be generated. Various handlers are available to generate content. CGI programs may be written to generate content for your site."
		</p>
		
		<p>There are several ways it decide what the response is. Here are a few:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				<h4>Static files</h4>
				<p>What we will use. When the server receives a request, it finds the appropriate file and sends the contents of that file as the response.</p>
			</li>
			<li> 
				<h4>Templating engine</h4>
				<p>Uses a file that contains placeholders. When you request a file, it uses various sources of information to fill in the template, and then it sends you the completed file in response.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<h4>Programmatically-defined</h4>
				<p>The web server contains code that gets run every time it receives a request. That code somehow generates a response, which it sends to the requestor.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>This guide will focus on hosting static files, where each page you can view on your website corresponds to an actual file stored on the web server. But there is nothing forcing the web
			server to send a specific file or even the same thing every time in response to a request. Many web servers exist that host dynamic content.</p>

		<p>How does the server send a response to a given request? To answer this, it is necessary to take a brief look at a few concepts:</p>
	
		<h3>HTTP</h3>
		<p>HTTP is a simple (in concept) text-based protocol. It stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, and is used by our web server as the standard format for requests and responses.</p>
		<p>The main goal of HTTP is to transfer hypertext (hence the name). One such hypertext is HTML, which will be discussed shortly. However, it can be used to transfer anything,
			including arbitrary binary files.
		</p>
	
		<p>A simple HTTP request to "example.com/hello" might look like this:</p>
		<pre>
GET /hello HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
		</pre>
		<p>The first line specifies the method (GET), the resource (which page to get, "/hello"), and the version of HTTP you're using. The resource is relative to the website's URL, meaning if you want "example.com/foo/bar", you would send "GET /foo/bar". </p>
		<p>In response to this request, the server at example.com will send a response. It contains a header with various kinds of information, followed by the actual data you requested:</p>
		<pre>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
Content-Length: 1256
(Other headers omitted)

&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
	&lt;title&gt;Example Domain&lt;/title&gt;
	...
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
	&lt;h1&gt;Example Domain&lt;/h1&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
	domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iana.org/domains/example"&gt;More information...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div>
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
		</pre>
	
		<h3>HTML</h3>
		<p>HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, and is used to tell the structure and content of a web page.
			It consists of text, plus tags around the text (such as &lt;p&gt;hello&lt;/p&gt;) It will be discussed in more detail in a later section. </p>
	
		<p>This guide is written in HTML. You can view the HTML yourself within your browser, likely by right-clicking the page and selecting "View Page Source".</p>

		<h3>Routing, IP addresses, and port forwarding</h3>

		<p>A network is essentially a bunch of computers that are "next to" each other, all connected to the same router.</p>
		<p>Your router allows your network to talk to other networks. When your computer wants to send a request to another network, it sends the
			request to your router, and your router forwards the request towards the destination.
		</p>

		<p>An IP address identifies a computer (actually, it's more specific; we'll ignore that). It is just a number. For convenience, we split it into four numbers, each between 0 and 255 (e.g. 192.168.1.1).</p>
		<p>There are two types of IP addresses we care about:
			<dl>
				<dt>Private address</dt>
				<dd>Used only inside your network. Every computer in your network has one. However, it is meaningless outside of your network, because the same private address
					can be used in two different networks. The private addresses that you will see in your home network should start with 192.168.
				</dd>
				<dt>Routable (or public) address</dt>
				<dd>Can be used outside your network. Usually, in home networks, only your router has a routable address. Routable addresses are unique worldwide.</dd>
			</dl>
		</p>

		<p>In addition to having a destination IP address, internet traffic is associated with a port. (The reality is that it's more complicated and ports are associated with the transport layer of the protocol stack, but we'll ignore this.)
			A port is kind of like a TV channel number. Your TV gets multiple channels at once, and uses the channel number to tell which show to show you.
			Ports allow one computer connect to multiple things at a time. You could run a web server that handles requests on port 80 and and email server that handles requests on a different port
			at the same time, for example. Without ports, your computer can't tell if a given piece of data should go to the web server or the email server.
		</p>

		<p>People will connect to your website using a routable/public address. This is a problem since your computer doesn't have one; only your router does. And your router doesn't care
			about HTTP requests, so it normally throws them away. So, you must tell your router that if it receives an HTTP request, it should give it to your computer instead of throwing
			it away. This is done using "port forwarding". HTTP uses port 80 (and HTTPS, port 443) so this is done by telling your router to give your computer data heading for port 80 or 443.
			The process is covered in the "Configuration" section.
		</p>

		<h2>Security Concerns</h2>
		<p>Since we're just using static web pages, there is a greatly reduced security risk. However, there are still some security concerns:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If you don't keep your web server updated, attackers can attack the web server itself. Vulnerabilities are regularly found and
				fixed in web servers, so keeping your software up to date is important. Franklin (2001) notes that web server attacks are one of three
				most common attacking techniques, and it works as follows: "[the attacker sends] HTTP requests to the Web server... the communication will
				look legitimate to the firewall. When the request arrives at the Web server, it is serviced normally. However, due to a bug in the server 
				the specific request exploits that vulnerability." (p. 31-32)
			</li>
			<li>Attackers will actively scan your server for exploits. I ran an plain, completely unknown server for my personal use, and this was a daily occurrence. Franklin (2001) 
				gives an example: "An intruder will start his attempts by scanning the TCP/IP ports looking for Internet servers listening to ports. For example,
				the IIS Web server package includes an FTP server that listens on port 21." (p. 33)
			</li>
			<li>Everything you put on your web server is public. People can and will scan through it for anything that they might be able to use for an attack (passwords, configuration files,
				default admin pages, etc.)
			</li>
			<li>Configuring the server is somewhat complicated and can leave you exposed if you do it incorrectly.</li>
